Roadmap:
    Stamina
	    Only a factor during real time play
	    Fast movement will reduce stamina, low stamina will either make moving take multiple keypresses or empty stamina will simply prevent movement
	    Stopping increases stamina after a short delay
	    Forces the player to use stealth tactics instead of rushing through the level
    Doors
	    More difficult to bash open
	    Objects can be moved in front of the door to increase door health
	    Fix bug with door spawning when a hallway corners adjacent to a room
    Health and sanity
	    Sanity should increase over time while in the light and with no monster around
	    Health and sanity recovery with progress or healing items
	    
    Objectives and Floors
	    Objective ideas
		    Item that needs to be found
		    Puzzle that needs to be done (maybe involving that item?)
    Light
	    Multiple sources
	    Ignitable torches (tinderboxes too?)
	    Multiple colours
	    Two player FOVs, a short one that will show nearby items (using local light and the lantern), one that will show distant light sources
	    Light intensity for each tile, lower the farther away from the source it is
	    Low light intensities are less visible the farther away you are
    Stealth mechanics
	    Movement will cause noise
	    Light intensity, noise, and sanity all factors in visibility
	    Objects to hide in, will lower visibility but take extra actions to move out of and decrease visibility
	    A dialog that tells you when you are being chased and when the monster is searching for you
    Monster
	    Monster paths directly to your location until you turn the lantern off, even if you go out of sight. Maybe path to and search the room you are in instead of pathing directly to your location? 
    Game
	    Pausing
	    Saving and loading
	    Delete save file on death
	    Keep track of high scores
    Code
	    Refactor to decrease coupling
	    Seperate files into src, lib, doc, res etc.
