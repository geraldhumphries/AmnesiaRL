Roadmap:
    Doors
	    Objects can be moved in front of the door to increase door health
	    Fix bug with door spawning when a hallway corners adjacent to a room
    Health and sanity
	    Health and sanity recovery with progress or healing items
    Objectives and Floors
	    Objective ideas
		    Item that needs to be found
		    Puzzle that needs to be done (maybe involving that item?)
    Light
	    Multiple colours
	    Low light intensities are less visible the farther away you are
	    Tile brightness should depend on light intensity
	Sound:

    Stealth mechanics
	    Movement and actions will cause noise
	    Light intensity, noise, and sanity all factors in visibility
	    Objects to hide in, will lower visibility but take extra actions to move out of and decrease visibility
	    A dialog that tells you when you are being chased and when the monster is searching for you
    Monster
	    Path directly to the player on spawn until game switches to real time
	    Attempt to locate the player based on sound and light
    Game
	    Pausing
	    Saving and loading
	    Delete save file on death
	    Keep track of high scores
    Code
	    Refactor to decrease coupling
